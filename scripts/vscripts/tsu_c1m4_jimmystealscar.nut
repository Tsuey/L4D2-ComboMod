/*****************************************************************************
**  The base game already has anv_mapfixes.nut, so in order to avoid conflicts
**  due to the fact that official implementation dodged scope complications by
**  running all code on "worldspawn", here I'm also running my code for new
**  standalone mods on it so copy the base game's Game Events 1:1 but include
**  the original Apply_Quadmode_Map_Specific_Fixes() call followed by my new
**  one, so it overall extends functionality by overriding the base original.
**
**  This is a sloppy workaround and has the same problem as all original use
**  of mapspawn.nut in that all authors would need to call the functions for
**  all mods for this to work... but for the current once-off, it'll be OK.
**
**  Several alternatives were attempted. If Apply_Jimmy_Steals_Car() changed
**  to ::Apply_Quadmode_Map_Specific_Fixes but with an attempted overloaded
**  function "<- function( strMod = "tsu_c1m4_jimmystealscar" )" to "layer"
**  on top of it "tricking" the base game into running the new code, it just
**  takes the last-most declared function. Identical result without the phony
**  parameter. I'll need to properly implement scope for this to work best.

//
//	Versus doesn't have this problem, but Coop would as it handles stats/outros a bit different.

// TODO_FIX_ABOVE_FOR_COOP

// TODO :: OTHER ISSUES (documented here on 7/24/2021):
//
//	1. For unknowable reasons, Tank bot AI is 50% pacifist. They will get close then not
//	   attack... at all. If you step away, they'll punch, if you're far away, they'll throw
//	   a rock. This is unplayably broken and might be caused by how I delete finale logic.
//
//	2. Even with "_jimmy_nav_step", if 3 Survivor bots run through from the outside and into
//	   the elevator, it's possible one will get stuck on the sides -- "r_drawclipbrushes 2"
//	   reveals that Valve's clip is thick, so I thought to thicken mine, but I doubt that
//	   would be 100% anyway... trigger_push? Too much effort... just keep it in mind.
//
//	3. When Gnome Chompsky enters (NOTE: "Gnome Chompski" is often how I spell it which is
//	   WRONG so do correct it, based on the linguist "Noam Chomsky") the disco ball needs
//	   a vertical-moving func_movelinear to move it DOWN then back UP so it doesn't hit part
//	   of the map. Should be simple, but will take time / testing I don't want to spend now.
//
//	4. The big one: I need to actually change this into a "Holdout / Standard finale". With
//	   proper points awarded. Or hard-code in "fake gascan pours" depending on time spent
//	   in the finale. This also makes it unplayably broken... in Versus mode, at least.

	// it's "layered loud" when near Gnome Chompsky with a radius, plus Plays Everywhere.

	// Experimental Continued: ACTUALLY MORE LOGICAL THAN EXPECTED... while 20000 radius
	// isn't very far, nor even entirely functional, it still does sound good, and if
	// there's several "layered copies" -- in this case LEFT speakers have 2 copies and
	// the RIGHT speakers have 2 copies, combined with the "Play Everywhere" -- the end
	// result is a very realistic audible experience !!

	// EXPLANATION :: The "_everywhere" copy isn't mandatory, BUT if the player isn't
	// within vicinity of the 20000 radius or walks out of that radius after the song
	// starts, it won't play when walking back in -- this is just an "ambient_generic"
	// quirk because the same can be seen by being far away from Gnome Chompsky when
	// the "sparkshower" sound effect plays, then rapidly noclipping at him, where it
	// is clearly not audible because player wasn't in radius. At 5000 radius, music
	// started dampening far before either extreme end of the atrium... at 10000, it
	// lasted until at least the extreme end walls of the atrium... at 20000, it was
	// increased to this and even though the music seemed to fade with mitigated return
	// this number ensures a Survivor can't step outside of the radius. Overall, the
	// "_everywhere" copy can be done without, as it's the 4x "_stereo" that localize
	// the music in a believable way and are still loud enough to be heard everywhere,
	// reducing the "_everywhere" copy to more of a failsafe. Overall, it was important
	// to me that the speaker models sound like they're emitting sound, but at the
	// original 5000 radius it ceased when walking too far away -- but not at 20000 !!

	// the music had already started... if not, maybe "ambient_music" is necessary to
	// look into, but even that on c2m5 Dark Carnival 5 has quirks like not being audible

	// LIGHT_DYNAMIC BUG ?!
	//
	//	Some lights, specifically "_jimmy_disco_17_spot" when tested, only illuminate
	//	entities and not the world -- this light, when tested arbitrarily, after it
	//	had its color changed to try and visually identify where it was it was really
	//	difficult to find until I ClearParent'd and ent_teleport'd it to various spots,
	//	where it did successfully illuminate if pointing at a prop_static but only lit
	//	that prop_static. THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AS ALL LIGHTS ARE CREATED EQUALLY.
	//
	//	Also: THE QUIRK DIDN'T JUST START HAPPENING, IT HAPPENED BEFORE LIMIT WORKAROUND.
	//
	// When bugged, ent_dump doesn't show Spawnflags even if 0 (both), 1 (props) or 2 (world),
	// but while setting this specific light to 0 didn't fix it, and 1 was identical to 0,
	// setting to 2 did de-illuminate the prop_static and get the spotlight back!
	//
	// 18/18 light_dynamics are mine, so this TEST_ONLY'd all 18 as spotlights-only which do
	// not illuminate prop_statics. Result was that even the toycar wasn't illuminated at all
	// and it was F-UGLY, so this isn't an option.
	//
	// At the end of the day, constant or random light_dynamics (it doesn't really matter)
	// will have a hissy-fit and limit its illumination. Maybe this is CPU/GPU holding back
	// from things being intense, maybe it's a bug, but regardless I know all the lights are
	// identical, this is just an engine-level quirk that I simply need to accept... and can
	// not notice substantially, as at most it's 2-3 spotlights that are missing. There will
	// also be multiples of each color, so the problem only stands out when I'm seeking out
	// a random light of very specific unique coloring. I could work this out further, determine
	// if it's always the same light_dynamic for w/e reason, but CPU/GPU may be inconsistent!
	//
	// LAPTOP changed LOW/MED/LOW to VERYHIGH/HIGH/HIGH and my light_dynamics still don't have
	// shadows, but it was laggier, like the lights might've had smoother spots... but that's
	// it... I thought these used to have shadows? Maybe my INTEL INTEGRATED just doesn't support

More particle effects:

	center of elevator for glass breakage		"effect_name" "window_glass"
	play for kiosk and map display wood puffs	"effect_name" "bridge_smokepuff"

Consider simply spawning and insta-Breaking this to create easy wood debris:

	"model" "models/props_junk/wood_crate002a.mdl"

Sound effect options:

	When elevator glass breaks:

		"message" "Breakable.MatGlass"
		"message" "Breakable.Glass"

	When Jimmy pounds the glass (too RNG if it's a real zombie, probably ignore this):

		"message" "Bounce.Glass"
		"message" "Glass.Break"

	Options for when kiosk and map display break:

		"message" "SmashCave.WoodRockCollapse"
		"message" "WoodenDoor.Break"
		"message" "Wood_Box.Break"

	Play lightly for the frontal fan blade:

		"message" "Chainsaw.FullThrottle"

	Don't forget these, they do need syncing with particles though:

		"message" "c2m5.fireworks_launch"
		"message" "c2m5.fireworks_burst"


NEEDS SPIN + PARTICLE EFFECT FOR EXPLOSION + BEEPING TIMER... BUT OVERALL, IT'S CLOSE, AND IT HAS EZ-BOUNCE

ent_create pipe_bomb_projectile
script Entities.FindByName( null, "hi" ).SetVelocity( Vector( 90, 90, 90 ) );



have the alligator come out and chomp and kill zombies

when it's Tank, have the atrium pitch-black (vin diesel / jeff) -- disco ball OFF -- but 1 beam
... 1 beam on the disco ball points to exactly where the Tank is at all times, as if Chompsky is HELPING
... then, 2nd Tank wave is of course 2 Tanks with 2 spotlights pointing out where they are at ALL times
... maybe need a trigger_look for this or something, so the beam/spot rotate to face it



trigger_finale ForceFinaleStart == gnome chompsky does this 5 seconds after pitchblack... does same 1 thing as relay I deleted





add and parent a "pimp mobile" light_dynamic **UNDERNEATH HIS CAR** that lights up the path but overall just looks stylish
++ it should be pink... then, depending on how the "frontal blades" go, maybe add a 2nd light_dynamic that's colored white
++ caution though: env_projectedtexture + light_dynamic == SIGNIFICANT PERF COSTS
... advantage is that 10 years ago my PC took a noticeable perf hit from it... modern PC's won't care at all.



when car comes in, fire break to the map, break to kiosk, kill to env_player_blocker on the map
maybe play wood-breaking particle effects and then, for just the kiosk, leave a pile of wood behind

thus need:

1. glass break sound and particle
2. wood break sound, particle and prop left behind



common_male01 was ditched quick for common_male_riot just b/c "why not?"



JIMMY GIBBS STEALS CAR

// Spawning "common_male_jimmy" directly will always chase Survivors NOT the goal, so create male01 and replace its model.
// But, when male01 and changed, it will T-pose, so I'm effectively back to "square one" 10 years ago.
// Using NetProps.GetPropInt( Entities.FindByName( null, g_UpdateName + "_jimmygibbs" ), "m_nModelIndex" ) instead will
// still produce the T-pose Jimmy Gibbs... it won't animate... not sure, how to get it TO animate, in the past I thought
// it just "figured itself out" after sometime... but I need 100% reliability. The new SetSequence WILL brute-force it!!
// Where GetSequence() revealed that 99 is bashing something in front of it and 118 is bashing and kicking the ground.
// And 120 is more trying to bash through a wall so looks more approprirate for the elevator than 99.

// gascan with skin 1 as "prop_physics_OVERRIDE" will prevent them from getting shot and thus appear "empty", so an EASY solution




gascans need to glow white not blue
gascans need to be indestructible from shooting hence appear empty
when top elevator button is pressed z_common_limit 0 and ent_fire infected ignite to there's no more

when jimmy gibbs breaks glass set z_common_limit back to 30

env_sparh and slightly angle top elevator button

c1m4_jimmygibbs_-prefixed functions for each "phase" where new info_goal_infected_chase will need to be spawned in



what about my scope? my round_start and player_connect_full in anv_mapfixes.nut are worldspawn scope

how do I get those same events done by my new tsu_ file?

answer: just use the same Game Events copy/paste game will use last-most made -- so, override it w/ Apply_Quad_Mode-etc BUT ADD my 2nd new function



lookup datamaps for "CScavengeProgressDisplay" to see if I can set it to 13/13... but single player would need to be customized

info_zombie_spawn can only spawn in by "population" and I don't want to distribute a modified populations.txt with my mod,
and either way Jimmy Gibbs doesn't follow info_goal_infected_chase anyway -- so the SetModel hack/workaround is mandatory


AS SURVIVORS DESCEND HAVE HIM KICKING THE CANS HE SUPPOSEDLY POURED, THEN ONCE REACH BOTTOM HAVE HIM AGGRO SURVIVORS

DEFINITELY DON'T USE THE SLOW-MOTION, AS PEOPLE ARE OVER-FAMILIAR

VASTLY SUPERIOR TO PROP_DYNAMIC BECAUSE SOUNDS / ANIMATIONS ARE ALREADY THERE -- I JUST CAN'T MAKE HIM "TRIP" ON WAY TO CAR

jimmy himself is immune to headshots, while male01 isn't, I guess merely changing the model gives him that ability

Z_COMMON_LIMIT 0 DURING THE EVENT, AND WHEN ELEVATOR STARTS KILL ALL "INFECTED", SET LIMIT 0, SPAWN JIMMY

HAVE JIMMY RUN INTO THE SCENE OUT FROM NOWHERE WHEN THE ELEVATOR STARTS, TO KICK CANS ON THE WAY DOWN
DROP CANS FROM AIR SO THEY LAND RANDOMLY, STARTGLOWING, DELETE SCAVENGE, ALTER TRIGGER_FINALE TO "STANDARD",
ENV_INSTRUCTOR_HINTS RE-ADD, LOGIC_RELAY FOR GLASS BREAK / OUTRO PLAY (IGNORE THE "ALTERNATIVE PIPE BOMB" SEQUENCE
FOR NOW, AS GLASS BREAK IS EASY), MORE SUBTLE ENV_SPARKS / ON FUNC_BUTTON ELEVATOR, NO SLOW-MOTION... IT BEING
A REAL JIMMY GIBBS SOLVES THE BLUE STRIPES, AND LUCKILY HE'S ALREADY 100% HEADSHOT-IMMUNE SO HEALTH CAN BE INFINITE.
HE'LL JUST BE SHOT BACK FROM HIS INFO_GOAL_INFECTED_CHASE AS SURVIVORS SHOOT AT HIM THROUGH THE GLASS, WHICH SIMPLY
MAKES HIM MORE INTERACTIVE THAN THE ORIGINAL... ****UAT HDD VERSION HAS MORE SOUL****.

	"#commentary\com-dynamicpaths.wav"	"[Kim Swift] Something that was always sad for us to watch in Left 4 Dead was that players would always choose an optimized path through a level once they'd played the map a couple times. That meant the hard work we put into other areas of the map would never be seen. So, one thing we wanted to add in Left 4 Dead 2 was the ability for the AI Director to change the path of the survivors through a level, so they have to take a different path each time.  The cemetery contains one example of this new approach.  There are four different paths that the AI Director can create for the survivors.  It does this by spawning in and out particular crypts and gates."
	"#commentary\com-lasersights.wav"	"[Jay Pinkerton] The laser-sight weapon upgrade came from an experiment during the development of the first Left 4 Dead.  Though we didnt end up shipping them at the time. While developing Left 4 Dead 2, when we were talking about interesting items that players could scavenge out of the levels, we remembered the visual impact of those red laser beams. The original intention of the item was to increase the accuracy of the guns, but the more valuable benefit was accidental:  you could now see where the other members of your team were aiming. We also liked the choices that confronted players when they had to decide whether or not to swap out their upgraded weapon for one of a different style."
	"#commentary\com-localmusic.wav"	"[Erik Wolpaw] When deciding what to do about the music for Left 4 Dead 2 we faced some interesting challenges. Some of the music in Left 4 Dead 1 plays an iconic and important role in game play, and we felt that it shouldn't really be changed. On the other hand, the game is set in the Southern United States, which is rich with musical identity, so we also felt that adding some local flavor to each campaign would really help set the tone for that campaign. The solution to bridging the gap between the new 'local' campaign music and the more traditional horror music from the first game was solved in several ways.  First, we kept all the original themes from Left 4 Dead 1 but arranged them in a style consistent with the local campaign's theme.  Second, we wrote an overarching set of cinematic \"southern goth\" pieces for entire game.   Finally, we wrote new pieces for the new characters in the style of Left 4 Dead 1.  By doing all this, we establish that these are new characters in new places but they are sharing the experience of everyone else in the Left 4 Dead universe."
	"#commentary\com-secretingredients.wav"	"[Bronwen Grimes] The infected textures are part hand-painted, part photographic reference.  One of our team members had a nightmare folder full of photographs of people suffering from bizarre diseases and injuries.  They were so hard to look at that the infected actually contain none of these.   Instead, the secret ingredients for infecting normal-looking human textures are photos of housing insulation and potato skins."
	"#commentary\com-story.wav"	"[Chet Faliszek] In Left 4 Dead 2 we wanted to give players who were looking for a narrative a little more.   To do this, we introduce the four Survivors to each other and the infection as we begin the game.   This lets us see the world changing through their eyes.  And the world is changing, each new Campaign shows a different stage and reaction to the infection.  We start with CEDAs nave underwhelming response and end with the Militarys cold but needed resolve to save only those they can. We also connect each Campaign.  So while you know you escape Whispering Oaks in Dark Carnival, you also know that is just one escape of many on your journey to safety in New Orleans.  Time does pass between campaigns, but each campaign starts with the previous rescue vehicle.  We also continue to spread hints and clues to the infection.  There is more 'Story' in the dialogue this time around, but players should still search for and read graffiti and notes in the world.  Observant players of Left 4 Dead will notice some tie-ins to the story as both games are set in the same world."
	"#commentary\com-traditionalcrescendo.wav"	"[Kerry Davis] This is the only 'traditional' Crescendo Event in The Parish campaign.  In Left 4 Dead 1, every Crescendo Event was essentially a button press where players held out in one spot until the infected stopped coming.  While we added the onslaught and optional crescendo variations, we felt that the old-school Left 4 Dead style event still had some life in it."
	"#commentary\com-welcome.wav"	"[Gabe Newell] Hi, my name is Gabe Newell, and welcome to Left 4 Dead 2.  We love this style of zombie-driven cooperative gameplay.  Tom Leonard and the rest of the Left 4 Dead 2 team have had a great time building on the design and game mechanics of the original and we hope you have as much fun playing the game as we did making it. To listen to a commentary node, put your crosshair over the floating commentary symbol and press your use key. To stop a commentary node, put your crosshair over the rotating node and press the use key again. Some commentary nodes may take control of the game in order to show something to you. In these cases, simply press your use key again to stop the commentary.  Please let me know what you think after you have had a chance to play Left 4 Dead 2.  I can be reached at gaben@valvesoftware.com.  I get about 10,000 emails each time we release a game, and while I can't respond to all of them, I do read all of them.  Thanks, and have fun!"

BEST OPTION TO STOP VALVE'S ELEVATOR CONVERSATION == INTERRUPT IT WITH ANOTHER ONE

Previously I had this code:

	// Nullify the !activator "c1m4startelevator" SpeakResponseConcept in order to avoid
	// the now-obsolete elevator chatter.

	//EntFire( "button_elev_3rdfloor", "AddOutput", "OnPressed player:CancelCurrentScene::2:-1" );
	EntFire( "button_elev_3rdfloor", "AddOutput", "OnPressed !activator:SpeakResponseConcept:c1m1_elevator_smoke:0.1:-1" );

	^^^
	I don't want to re-create the entire button and all its Outputs, and lack Stripper:Source to
	just extract the 1 undesirable Output... SO_CANCELLING_IT_OUT_AFTER_ITS_ALREADY_PLAYED_IS_ONLY_OPTION.

But following up one SpeakResponseConcept with another doesn't stop the first, and while CancelCurrentScene
will immediately cease the speaking character's line, their subtitles still persist on-screen AND the characters
to respond to that scene still play out... so, the best / ONLY option is to play another *.VCD file to overwrite
Valve's from running entirely.

This offers SOME_UNIQUE_OPPORTUNITY, to have Valve's line play... then abruptly cancel it with character's shock
that the objective (they've grown accustomed to for 10-11+ years) has already been completed !!

In short, playing another *.VCD file via logic_choreographed_scene at the right time to solve this problem automatically.

PIPE BOMB -- IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE IT "LIVE" -- TESTS -- START

Faking it process:

	1. Spawn a pipe_bomb_projectile w/ fuse, blinking light, explosive particle,
	   beep and explosion sounds and func_rotator parented to it

	2. Give it a velocity toward the elevator to start bouncing in that direction

	3. At different timings, change its gravity to fake different heights in each of its bounces

	4. When it reaches near its end, gravity should be strong enough so it "lands",
	   cease fuse/light/blink/beep, and explode particle/sound

	5. Break the elevator glass as usual

TL;DR: It has been a whole 10 years later and I'm still doing the same exact shit... in 10 more of these
       my Mom and Dad may surely be dead, or I'll even be dead myself or dying from obesity / heart-related
       issues if I keep flip-flopping with my weight control. To even AtomicStryker a decade ago, "m_bIsLive"
       is purely useless and deceptive, and Thinks were required in L4D1 to get it to bounce which it does
       automatically in L4D2. Only workaround is to construct a pipebomb from scratch faking the entire thing.
       As to HOW to fake it, there's many ways... my need is 100% cosmetic and not functional / player-thrown.

PIPE BOMB -- IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE IT "LIVE" -- TESTS -- END



PARTI-COOLS SAMPLING BEGIN!

Using this as each System location "-4427 -3460 65" and Target1 "-4427 -3460 512" and Target2 "-4327 -3460 216",
applying each only when just a sole System or the 1st Target isn't enough, all of these were demonstrated to work
and be absolutely minimalistic to work:

	https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Talk:List_of_L4D2_Particles
	^^^
	There is no standalone "flare" or "trail" particle in the entire list that works
	(tested with just 1 System and 1 System with 1 Target), meaning "fireworks_explosion_01"
	is just the flare-less explosion while "fireworks_01" is the flare with explosion --
	the caveat is that using "fireworks_01" means that, regardless of the System/Target
	difference (and the oddity that a Target IS REQUIRED even though it really serves
	no observable purpose), the "fireworks_01" flare always shoots up to the same height
	and shoots far beyond a lower Target... the Target is where the explosion occurs, but
	not where the flare ends. Firing "Stop" to an active "fireworks_01" will only prevent
	the explosion but the flare will travel to its usual hard-coded height.

	This means that "fireworks_01"-4 are my best/only options, AND they need to be embedded
	into the ground to "fake" the flare traveling less height.

These don't have flares:

	script make_particle( "_fireexplo1", "-4427 -3460 65", "0 0 0", "fireworks_explosion_01", "-4427 -3460 512" );
	script make_particle( "_fireexplo2", "-4427 -3460 65", "0 0 0", "fireworks_explosion_02", "-4427 -3460 512" );
	script make_particle( "_fireexplo3", "-4427 -3460 65", "0 0 0", "fireworks_explosion_03", "-4427 -3460 512" );
	script make_particle( "_fireexplo4", "-4427 -3460 65", "0 0 0", "fireworks_explosion_04", "-4427 -3460 512" );

These do have flares and are embedded into the ground, with Targets changed so explosion occurs at end of flare,
and interestingly these don't even require a Target since the explosion will occur at the end of the flare line:

	script make_particle( "_fire1", "-4427 -3460 -700", "0 0 0", "fireworks_01" );
	script make_particle( "_fire2", "-4427 -3460 -700", "0 0 0", "fireworks_02" );
	script make_particle( "_fire3", "-4427 -3460 -700", "0 0 0", "fireworks_03" );
	script make_particle( "_fire4", "-4427 -3460 -700", "0 0 0", "fireworks_04" );

Flare doesn't work with or without Target 1, I even tried a Target 2 to be thorough... and the "mini_fireworks"
works identically with just the System or Target 1, so is best left just as the sole System:

	script make_particle( "_miniflare", "-4427 -3460 65", "0 0 0", "mini_firework_flare", "-4427 -3460 512", "-4427 -3460 1024" );
	script make_particle( "_mini", "-4427 -3460 65", "0 0 0", "mini_fireworks" );

This works by itself as a System or with a Target, it simply "clones" itself and plays a 2nd time for the Target:

	script make_particle( "_burning", "-4427 -3460 65", "0 0 0", "burning_General", "-4427 -3460 512" );

Exhibits no difference if a Target is used, so only use a System for it:

	script make_particle( "_puff", "-4427 -3460 65", "0 0 0", "bridge_smokepuff" );

Needs more testing -- it doesn't look like Particle Browser at all, as just a System or with 1/2 Targets, it's just
the smallest most useless spec of glass explosion:

	script make_particle( "_glass", "-4427 -3460 65", "0 0 0", "window_glass", "-4427 -3460 512", "-4327 -3460 216" );
	script make_particle( "_glass", "-4427 -3460 65", "0 0 0", "window_glass", "-4327 -3460 216" );

These are its sub-particles, "impact_glass" has its own subs but is worthless to me even in Particle Browser:

		window_glass
		window_glass_child_base
		window_glass_child_bits
		window_glass_child_smoke

These work 100%, just use these, IDK how to use Targets on this one, but using the subs works just fine, ignore
the "_base" sub-particle since I think that's where the glass actually is that breaks and mine isn't above players:

	script make_particle( "_glass", "-4084 -3404 155", "0 0 0", "window_glass_child_bits" );
	script make_particle( "_glass", "-4084 -3404 80", "0 0 0", "window_glass_child_smoke" );

This will create 1 sparkshower at System, then "clones" at Target 1 and Target 2 -- it's actually this case where
it was proven necessary for the Targets to also "inherit" the same Angles, which is 100% harmless for other particle
types that don't use Angles... but here, it saves from having to use 3 separate Systems:

		EDIT:
		^^^^
		Actually just use 3 separate make_particle() calls in this case -- I'm not going to add Angle
		parameters, requiring 2 extra parameters, just for this 1 particle, because the model that these
		sparks come out of is "flared outwards", so each of the Targets would actually need unique and
		separate Angles... so, K.I.S.S... even if it's not what Valve would do.

Thus, so while this is possible (if System Angles inherited to the Targets, which they don't any longer):

	script make_particle( "_sparks", "-4427 -3460 65", "-90 0 0", "fireworks_sparkshower_01", "-4427 -3460 512", "-4327 -3460 216" );

Do this instead for more control -- without having make_particle() cater to a roughly-once-off:

	script make_particle( "_sparksa", "-4427 -3460 65", "-90 0 0", "fireworks_sparkshower_01" );
	script make_particle( "_sparksb", "-4427 -3460 512", "-90 0 0", "fireworks_sparkshower_01" );
	script make_particle( "_sparksc", "-4327 -3460 216", "-90 0 0", "fireworks_sparkshower_01" );

String lights CANNOT_BE_DELETED once drawn, so for the **trolley** use move_rope/keyframe_rope instead...
also, BOTH_VARIANTS_PERSIST_ROUND_TRANSITION... they cannot be deleted AT_ALL, so I wonder if/how Valve
only spawns them in once for Dark Carnival... or maybe it's just the multi-colored lights with the issue?

		... they DO work, just they MUST be used in a way that they're PERMANENT for BOTH teams from the START

		... top has STRING, bottom is just floating glows, both persist round transition

		... STRINGING TOGETHER "env_sprite" TO MIMIC THESE **IS OUTSIDE THE SCOPE/EFFORT OF THIS ONCE-OFF USAGE** !!

	script make_particle( "_christmas", "-4427 -3460 65", "0 0 0", "string_lights_03", "-4427 -3460 512" );
	script make_particle( "_christmas", "-4427 -3460 65", "0 0 0", "string_lights_03_glow", "-4427 -3460 512" );

Balloons are an odd case but WORK_AS_DESIRED... deleting the System the balloon will still persist, but while
the System exists it can be SetParented to move even with the player! And they're washed away on round transition!
However, no Targets are computed at all here... Targets CANNOT be used to influence the "height" of the "string".

	script make_particle( "_balloon", "-4427 -3460 65", "0 0 0", "balloon" );

Pipebomb... top is the explosion, "_light" is burst+trail, "_b" is burst, "_c" is trail, "_fuse" is the fire
on top -- note that Targets in all these cases don't add or detract anything, thus just use Systems forever:

	script make_particle( "_pipe", "-4427 -3460 65", "0 0 0", "weapon_pipebomb" );
	script make_particle( "_pipeblink", "-4427 -3460 65", "0 0 0", "weapon_pipebomb_blinking_light" );
	script make_particle( "_pipeblinkb", "-4427 -3460 65", "0 0 0", "weapon_pipebomb_blinking_light_b" );

	script make_particle( "_pipefuse", "-4427 -3460 65", "0 0 0", "weapon_pipebomb_fuse" );

Wood breakage particles SUCK, tried all these, all particles with "wood" in the name:

	script make_particle( "burning_wood_01", "-4427 -3460 65", "0 0 0", "burning_wood_01" );

	script make_particle( "burning_wood_02c", "-4427 -3460 65", "0 0 0", "burning_wood_02c" );
	script make_particle( "impact_wood", "-4427 -3460 65", "0 0 0", "impact_wood" );

	script make_particle( "infected_door_slash_wood", "-4427 -3460 65", "0 0 0", "infected_door_slash_wood" );

These are the only 2 reasonable ones, but the debris still very tiny so would need SEVERAL:

	script make_particle( "infected_door_hit_wood", "-4427 -3460 65", "0 0 0", "infected_door_hit_wood" );
	script make_particle( "infected_door_slash_wood", "-4427 -3460 65", "0 0 0", "infected_door_slash_wood" );

Best solution == just spawn a crate and insta-break it, it'll look better than the above garbage.

Should function have entity cleanup?

	NO.

	While "fireworks_sparkshower_01" would suffice a System delete after 8-9 seconds, and particles
	like "string_lights_03" indeed persist even round transition, there'd still be the case with "balloon"
	where it can be SetParented and move with things, which is required to move it, even though its System
	can be deleted allowing the particle to exist... confusing situation, thus this stuff is too situational.

PARTI-COOLS DONE.



MAKE FUNCTION LOOSE ENDS

#1 - Need to create a "make_choreo" or "make_scene" function

	It shouldn't need an origin so ignore that parameter.

	Use these Keyvalues for "logic_choreographed_scene":

		"busyactor" "0"
		"onplayerdeath" "0"
		"SceneFile" "scenes/mechanic/worldc1m4b01.vcd"
		"targetname" "tsu_jimmy_reffinal_choreo"

	I need to interrupt the following lines with a substitute VCD:

		** Note that nullifying current scene w/ "CancelCurrentScene" or "SpeakResponseConcept" both FAIL.
		   It's because "SpeakResponseConcept" just works differently -- whereas the LCS entity is a full-on
		   interruption and ceases whatever was going on before... making it GOOD for my use, but also BAD
		   for retail/canonical gameplay since it interrupts active lines.

		1. Elevator chat, I want to abruptly cut them off... they're SHOCKED (to their systems...)

		2. "Get some gas" etc. lines after finale starts, even though turned to "Standard"

	What each number does:

		If an Actor is talking "busyactor"

			Start immediately 0
			Wait for actor to finish 1
			Interrupt at next interrupt event 2
			Cancel at next interrupt event 3

		On player death "onplayerdeath"

			Do Nothing 0
			Cancel Script and return to AI 1

	Test-case to confirm working:

		"Producer_WorldC1M3B16"	"<clr:168,71,96>Rochelle: Jimmy Gibbs Jr. Yay."

#2 - Copy "make_sparks" for a "make_shake"... mostly just so my PRECACHING of it makes to full fruition / sense

	See "env_shake" example elsewhere in this *.TXT.

	It's not a priority or useful and "pro players" would just find it distracting.

	Note that Tanks chasing you DOES ALSO SHAKE, so it's sorta redundant anyway.

#3 - Pipebomb's bare-bones creation steps (100% ignoring ALL dead-ends, they're documented ELSEWHERE)

	"PipeBomb.Bounce" should be optional since the Vector'd entity should make the sounds.

	"PipeBomb.TimerBeep" is definitely necessary.

	SpawnEntityFromTable( "pipe_bomb_projectile", { targetname = g_UpdateName + "_jimmy_pipebomb", origin = Vector( -4528, -3261, 22 ) } );

	SetParent fuse / blinking light / explosion particle/sound / beep sound and make_rotator to it

	Give it a Velocity toward the elevator to start bouncing in that direction

	At different timings, change its Gravity to fake different heights in each of its bounces

		NetProps.SetPropFloat( Entities.FindByName( null, g_UpdateName + "_jimmy_pipebomb" ), "m_flGravity", 0.1 );

		0.4 grav and 0.2 friction may ODDLY be the defaults, idk how to change friction / won't need to anyway

	When it reaches near its end, Gravity should be strong enough to make it "land"

	Cease particles and explode sound... adjust glass break timings

I've come a long way... to have sounds/hints 100% done... to only have THE_ABOVE remain.



ADDITIONAL IDEAS TO ASSESS

cut microphone on the trolley, wanted to support vocalize spamming / singing along... too difficult to get a working base atm

	script SpawnEntityFromTable( "env_microphone", { targetname = g_UpdateName + "_jimmy_xtra_microphone", origin = Vector( -4420, -1981, 17 ), SpeakerName = g_UpdateName + "_jimmy_xtra_speaker", speaker_dsp_preset = 57, spawnflags = 63, SmoothFactor = 0, Sensitivity = 1, MaxRange = 100 } );
	script SpawnEntityFromTable( "info_target", { targetname = g_UpdateName + "_jimmy_xtra_speaker", origin = Vector( -4420, -1981, 17 ), spawnflags = 0 } );
	script SpawnEntityFromTable( "info_target", { targetname = g_UpdateName + "_jimmy_xtra_speaker", origin = Vector( -4420, -1981, 17 ), spawnflags = 0 } );

consider using a https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Point_spotlight / env_beam / env_laser to:
... Gnome Chompsky will help, with an Infected-only filtered beam/laser, kill zombies with his spinning disco ball

Gnome Chompsky bored now; hop aboard the trolley!

note I haven't yet included the "tunnel of love entrance archway" with lights... I want Gnome to be more "mobile"
than that... so I guess that, plus the subtitle "sing-a-long"", will be EXCLUDED this time around -- there's a thing as too much
--- put speakers on the archway

basketball spotlight entry w/ start of "save me some sugar" -> play that out -> "re your brains" -> "still alive" when escape is active

I spell Gnome Chompski's name wrong everywhere b/c of this

JEFF'S PC "LIVE UNSUSPECTING VICTIM" TESTING ISSUES

#1 - Ensure there's no leading 0 in targetnames that can break this:

	local strGascanTarget = g_UpdateName + "_jimmy_empty_gascan_" + RandomInt( 1, 13 );

#2 - Jeff's PC has Jimmy spawn with a Riotcop Faceshield, whereas my Laptop does not, albeit same settings

#3 - The first round was only producing a Male01 and not even a Riotcop, resulting in permstuck elevator

	Riotcop's model is precached, IDK why it failed, and cannot reproduce it -- it's NOT
	due to loading into map 4 from map 3 (but would've made sense as I only prior tested
	straight loads into map 4). I STRONGLY_SUSPECT it's not a failure of the "changemodel"
	function given that all the other functions 100% work !!

	Recall that spawning a Jimmy directly w/o SetModel() workaround results in him never
	chasing the goal... so the Riotcop was used since it chases and has extra immunity,
	but then #2's Faceshield issue was observed, and the 1st round failure leading to no
	Jimmy model entering the Jimmy-filtered trigger, resulting in permstucking in elevator.

	Infected players can't headshot and func_brush block bullets, so this was instead changed
	to "common_male01" which solved both #1 and #2:

		EntFire( g_UpdateName + "_jimmygibbs_spawner", "SpawnZombie", "common_male_riot,anv_mapfixes_jimmygibbs" );
									    ^^ common_male01

#4 - Need to eliminate Commons since it's a distraction from Jimmy if lots of zombies are chasing the goal

	Prevent it starting when he spawns to run past:

		function tsu_c1m4_jimmy_02_runningpast()
		{
			Convars.SetValue( "z_common_limit", 0 );
			EntFire( "infected", "Kill" );

	And restore it exactly when the glass breaks:

		function tsu_c1m4_jimmy_04_glassbreak()
		{
			Convars.SetValue( "z_common_limit", 30 );

#5 - Help players survive the first song

	Fireworks and damage triggers will help... but maybe a "carrot on a stick bile jar" that coaxes
	Commons by default to run into the propeller blade?

#6 - I've long-missed deleting a trigger_push

	Optionally I can delete "_jimmy_speaker_push" once the speakers have risen.

	Infected players aren't blocked by the Survivor-only clip to prevent them from touching it, so
	they can get permstuck ramming into the front of the "love gate".

	Option #1 == Create a gate-sized "SI Player and AI" clip that doesn't extend to ceiling.

	Option #2 == Change the trigger_push to only push "Survivors"

	DECISION :: Option #2, will allow players to "ride the raising love gate" up as it ascends, and
	they can reasonably get on top of it, and won't get stuck because it is ascending. Would be very
	funny to see a Hunter "abuse" this for a cheesy semi-damage pounce.

#7 - Bots cannot leave elevator b/c there's no nav leading out

	Bots still inside will 100% ignore attacked/incapped players outside because they cannot exit.

	Need to run some sort of "logic_timer Think" (noting that "AddThinkToEnt" is bad since doing that
	on worldspawn will persist it running on round transition) to detect bots still inside then warp
	them out sometime after glass breaks. Need to use VScript to detect the bot... as spawnflags can
	only detect "Client" which includes any Survivors/Infected (as it's the "NPC" flag that's Commons).

	SUPERIOR HIGH-EFFORT SOLUTION:

		When elevator reaches bottom, have elevator doors slightly open, but angled, and
		make use of make_sparks() again to add more sparks, but smaller, more frequent.
		Adjust the function to tweak it more maybe... or just suffice a copy of the button's.

		Like 5 seconds after glass breaks after real players have exited, THEN it's time to
		open the elevator doors (let's say Jimmy's car-hit/pipebomb hit it back into function)
		which will let bots exit safely... and doubly not make it a finale exploit spot.

		Kinda obsoletes the "nav clip" I added, but not really since it'll still help, only less.

#8 - Retry firing Stop to strung-light particles to get them to cease... pretty sure I confirmed fail on this before tho

#9 - Scoring... either copy LAST STAND FINALE's solution/alternative Kerry did add, or run normal Scavenge and "fake" 13 can pours
